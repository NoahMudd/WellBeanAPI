# WellBeanAPI
WellBeanAPI is a service that allows users to track certain health data points. They are prompted to answer a survey at the end of each day, and rate their sense of wellbeing. These data points are intended to give the user a sense of what habits make them feel their best.

## Features of this API: 
* Make your application an API
* Make your application a CRUD API
* Make your application asynchronous

### Current State
The current state of the API uses SwaggerUI to allow user input, which is then stored in memory. This means user input is not saved in between sessions. I have previously connected the API to a local database, so some artifacts of that are left in the code. A better user interface, more useful data storage, and graphing of some data is planned for the future.
